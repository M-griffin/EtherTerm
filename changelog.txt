Change Log 3.0.25 - 2016-01-09
    - Added Windows Close Event Handling to shutdown Windows on clicking X
    - Still need to add switch to check for Main Session, So Closing dialing 
      directory shuts down all windows, while just closing connection and secondary
      sessions just kills each session.  The base is already setup.
    - Update default ANSI theme screen names to match themes
      Still WIP on second test Theme Fire_Theme. Might just to test switching.

Change Log 3.0.24 - 2016-01-07

    - Created new folder in assets for to organize directory themes
    - Created new folder for fonts
    - Added Mid ANSI's for light bars to ini files
    - Renamed files for better theme organization.

Change Log 3.0.23 - 2016-01-06
    - Added Themes to the Dialing Directory, The ANSI/ASCII screen along with
      Light bars for both the systems list and light bar commands have always 
      been open and customizable.  Now by created a new DialDirectory.ini
      and appending 1..2..3.. like DialDirectory1.ini you can setup each ini to point
      to different theme templates to personalize your interface use to some 
      pre-make ones that will be created.  Themes can be quick switched using 
      then brackets '[' and ']' keys for switching between next and previous themes.
    - Todo, update the Redraw light bar commands once themes are switched.
    - Checked that Themes are working with different font sets, now to test menu
      templates for different light bar colors and positions alone with the system
      listing light bars, colors, and box sizes.      

Change Log 3.0.22 - 2016-01-05
    - Created new Fontset.xml file to hold all system fonts with names, height,
      width, filename and ESC sequence for automatic font switching.  
      The availability to set the sequence in the XML is an added bonus to set
      a preference.  For example.  If ESC[0;40 D is received for Amiga Topaz,
      however you preference is to see Topaz Plus, you can set this ESC sequence
      under the preferred font so it will be used instead.  All fonts are now
      configurable.
    - Also updated the Dialing Directory to pull front names from the new xml set.

Change Log 3.0.21 - 2016-01-05
    - Fixed Shutdown with Broadcaster

      modes and scaling for the best quality/performance.
    - Working on reintegrating the menu system.
    - Input passing to the menu system is now working.
    - Dialing Directory is now displaying with input for light bar movements.
      Right now only arrow keys are working. Need to look at default Key Mappings
      to make sure PAGEUP/DN etc are all captured correctly on the local side.
    
Change Log 3.0.20 - 2015-12-24
    - Good Progress, Finally have the Classes loading in sync and
      clean destruction in sync.
    - Also have added broadcaster to hold all active sessions.
    - Move main loop from Main() to Interface->Startup()
      This keeps sessions and windows alive, falling back to main
      seems to have been clearing pointers.  
    - Able to render the full VGA character setup in a basic window.
WIP
    - Still loads of work to do, test the SequenceDecoder.
    - Add processing and passing events to each session.
    - Getting session data and passing it back through to the decoder
      so it reaches he SequenceParser and renders on the screen.
    - Render scaling on the fly to different and pre-set sizes without blur
      when using texture filtering.

Change Log 3.0.19 - 2015-12-23
    - Reworked the startup and shutdown sequences.
    - Added weak_prt for shared_from_this() so the main session
      instance being passed would not lock and stay alive.
    - WIP SessionList container in the Interface, research the best 
      container for the job to easily main and release sessions.

Change Log 3.0.18 - 2015-12-22
    - Initial Startup sequence of session is working now. 
      Added startup() called externally to properly start the render
      with shared_from_this() object.  Now to work on renderer startup.

Change Log 3.0.17 - 2015-12-22
    - Code Cleanup and Working the MenuManager into the Local Session

Change Log 3.0.16 - 2015-12-22
    - Initial rework of MenuManager and the menu system completed.

    - Next is to incorporate into the interface to spawn the menu
      session, then rework connection spawns from the MenuManager
      with pointer to the Interface.
    - Added back TinyXML to get things up and working again. 
      The plan is to replace this with boost later on once the major
      rework is completed.

Change Log 3.0.15 - 2015-12-21
    - Added MenuFunction and MenuManager.
    - WIP Reworking MenuManager.
      Need to rework the system connection structure that is used to hold

      to remove all GPL code.

Change Log 3.0.14 - 2015-12-20
    - Added MenuIO, MenuConfig and MenuFunction
    - Did some initial rework on classes and methods.  Still need to finish up

Change Log 3.0.11 - 2015-12-19
    - Complete initial rework of Renderer class, along with
      The ScreenBuffer and PixelScreen Structs.  
    - NOTES: SetupCursorSurface() in renderer should be redone eventually
      to not use the underscore from the current font set since it can be 
      in different positions it's not ideal.  Should create a custom char
      for this eventually.
    - NOTES: Showing the blinking cursor is disabled at this time, get back
      to this once we have everything going again.
    - Next Items are the Data decoder, Input Data Queue, and Dialing Directory.

    - Created initial classes:
    Window Manager  - For Sessions and Windows for each connection including the Dialing Directory
    Surface Manager - Handles SDL Surface and Textures for Displaying Graphics
    Input Handler   - Handles Local Input and SDL Window Events
    Session         - Each Session will handle its own socket i/o, ANSI parser, window and rendering
    Interface       - Handles Spawning sessions and outgoing connections
    tcp_connection  - Initial socket class that spawn a new socket per session
