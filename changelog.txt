	Window Manager  - For Sessions and Windows for each connection incuding the Dialing Directory
	Surface Manager - Handles SDL Surface and Textures for Displaying Graphics
	Input Handler   - Handles Local Input and SDL Window Events
	Session         - Each Session will handle it's own socket i/o, ansi parser, window and rendering
	Interface       - Handles Spawning sessions and outgroing connections
	tcp_connection  - Initial socket class that spawn a new socket per session
